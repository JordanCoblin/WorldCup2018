# WorldCup2018

This repo includes the picks for each person participating in our 2018 quadrennial World Cup Pool.

The scoring format was a little complicated this year, so I wrote a script to read each person's picks and calculate scores.

To run the script:

```
pipenv run python read_sheet.py
```

The results are being visualized using Tableau here: https://public.tableau.com/profile/jordan1012#!/vizhome/WorldCupPool/Sheet1?publish=yes
